This is an example of a JSON plugin that creates a Sub Menu with launchable ELFs.

The "Name" and "Description" properties:
  Can be either an array of 7 strings (one for each supported language)
  or a single string (in which case it will be used for all languages).
  If you plan to use multiple languages, make sure there are exactly 7 strings
  (even if they are repeated), otherwise use the single string type.

  Supported languages are:
  0 - English
  1 - French
  2 - Spanish
  3 - German
  4 - Italian
  5 - Dutch
  6 - Portuguese

The "Icon" property:
  Can only be a pre-loaded icon from the current theme's icon set.
  It can be defined as a string or number, and you can see which
  string or ID belong to which icon on the file "XMB/dash/dash_icons.json".

  Alternatively, you can define a Custom Icon to use using the "CustomIcon" property,
  defining a path to a PNG or JPG image file.
  The path can use "{cwd}" to refer to the current OSDXMB directory.
  It can also use "?" to specify multiple device locations (mass?:/).

The "Category" property defines in which category the plugin will appear.
  0 - User
  1 - Settings
  2 - Photo
  3 - Music
  4 - Video
  5 - Game
  6 - Network

The "Type" property:

  There are several Plugin Types:
  "SUBMENU" - A Sub Menu that can contain other items of the same or different types (ELFs, Sub Menus, etc).
  "ELF" - A launchable ELF file.
  "CODE" - A special hardcoded function execution.

The "Value" property:
    On Plugins of the "ELF" type, it's an object with three properties:
      "Path" - An array of strings with the paths to the ELF file to launch.
               It can have as many pths as you want, the first valid path will be used.
               The path can use "{cwd}" to refer to the current OSDXMB directory.
               It can also use "?" to specify multiple device locations (mass?:/).
      "Args" - An array of strings with the arguments to pass to the ELF when launching it.
      "RebootIOP" - "true" or "false", to indicate if the IOP should be rebooted before launching the ELF, can be ommited.

    On Plugins of the "SUBMENU" type, it's an object with two properties:
      "Default" - The index of the item that will be highlighted when pressing the Enter button.
      "Items" - An array of objects that will be shown in the Sub Menu.
                Additionally to ELF and SUBMENU, these objects can have the following Types:
                - "CONTEXT" - An Side Menu with a collection of items.
                - "DIALOG" - A dialog screen.

For now, we will focus on this example on a simple Sub Menu with launchable ELFs to use as a template.
Place the following content of the file on a JSON file inside the "PLG" folder to enable it.
The name of the plugins can be anything you want, as long as it ends in ".json" or ".xml.
The plugins will be loaded in alphabetical order, that's why in the plugins included with OSDXMB
they are prefixed with the category and then a number to define where they are placed in the list.

This example creates a Folder Item in the Game Category called "Open PS2 Loader Collection" and shows 3
launchable ELFs inside it.
